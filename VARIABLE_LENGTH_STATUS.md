# Variable-Length Path Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025  
**Current State:** Functional for basic scenarios, NOT production-ready  
**Completion Estimate:** 70% (core implementation done, production hardening needed)

## Executive Summary

Variable-length path traversal (`MATCH (a)-[*min..max]->(b)`) is now **functionally implemented** and generates recursive CTE SQL for tested scenarios. However, **significant work remains** before this feature is production-ready.

### What Works ✅
- Parser recognizes all variable-length syntax patterns
- Query planner handles variable-length specifications
- SQL generator creates recursive CTEs with proper structure
- Basic patterns tested and generating SQL successfully

### What's Missing ❌
- Full schema integration (uses generic column name fallbacks)
- Multi-hop base case implementation (broken for min > 1)
- Comprehensive test coverage (only happy path tested)
- Error handling and input validation
- Performance testing and optimization
- Real database execution verification

## Detailed Implementation Status

### 1. Parsing (100% Complete) ✅

**Status:** Fully implemented and tested

**Capabilities:**
- `*1..3` - Range with min and max
- `*2` - Fixed length (exactly 2 hops)
- `*..5` - Upper bounded (1 to 5 hops)
- `*` - Unbounded (with default limits)
- `:TYPE*1..3` - Typed relationships

**Code Location:** `brahmand/src/open_cypher_parser/path_pattern.rs`

**Test Coverage:** All syntax patterns parsed correctly

---

### 2. Query Planning (100% Complete) ✅

**Status:** Fully implemented

**Capabilities:**
- `VariableLengthSpec` stored in `GraphRel` logical plan node
- Analyzer passes skip variable-length relationships appropriately
- No premature validation that would block valid queries

**Code Location:** 
- `brahmand/src/query_planner/logical_plan/mod.rs`
- `brahmand/src/query_planner/analyzer/`

**Test Coverage:** Queries reach SQL generation phase without errors

---

### 3. SQL Generation (70% Complete) ⚠️

**Status:** Basic implementation working, critical issues remain

#### What's Working:
- ✅ Recursive CTE generation with proper structure
- ✅ Base case for single hop (min=1)
- ✅ Recursive case with UNION ALL
- ✅ Hop count tracking and limits
- ✅ Cycle detection using array membership
- ✅ Table name extraction from schema
- ✅ ID column extraction from ViewScan

#### Critical Issues:

**Issue 1: Generic Column Name Fallbacks** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Problem:** Relationship columns use hardcoded `from_node_id`, `to_node_id`
- **Impact:** May not match actual schema (e.g., `follower_id`, `followed_id`)
- **Current Workaround:** Works if schema happens to use these names
- **Proper Fix Needed:** Extract actual column names from RelationshipViewMapping
- **Estimated Effort:** 4-8 hours
- **Code Location:** `brahmand/src/render_plan/plan_builder.rs` lines 165-175

**Issue 2: Multi-hop Base Case Not Implemented** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Problem:** Patterns like `*2` or `*3..5` use placeholder SQL: `WHERE false`
- **Impact:** Queries return no results or incorrect results for min > 1
- **Current Workaround:** Recursive case may compensate in some scenarios
- **Proper Fix Needed:** Generate chained JOINs for N hops
- **Estimated Effort:** 8-16 hours (complex)
- **Code Location:** `brahmand/src/clickhouse_query_generator/variable_length_cte.rs` line 123

**Issue 3: No Schema Validation** 🟡 IMPORTANT
- **Problem:** Doesn't verify that generated column names exist in actual tables
- **Impact:** SQL may be syntactically correct but semantically invalid
- **Proper Fix Needed:** Schema lookup and validation during SQL generation
- **Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

**Code Location:** 
- `brahmand/src/clickhouse_query_generator/variable_length_cte.rs`
- `brahmand/src/render_plan/plan_builder.rs`

### 4. Testing (40% Complete) ⚠️

**Status:** Basic happy path tested, comprehensive coverage missing

#### Tests Executed:
- ✅ Test 1-5: Basic relationships (AUTHORED, FOLLOWS, LIKED, PURCHASED)
- ✅ Test 6: `*1..3` range pattern - SQL generated
- ✅ Test 7: `*2` fixed length - SQL generated (but has placeholder bug)
- ✅ Test 8: `*..5` upper bounded - SQL generated
- ✅ Test 9: `*` unbounded - SQL generated
- ✅ Test 10: `:FOLLOWS*1..3` typed - SQL generated

#### Tests NOT Executed:
- ❌ Actual ClickHouse execution (only SQL generation tested)
- ❌ Heterogeneous paths (user->post->user, customer->product->review)
- ❌ Complex WHERE clauses on paths
- ❌ Property access on relationships (`r.since`, `r.weight`)
- ❌ Multiple variable-length patterns in single query
- ❌ Nested queries with variable-length paths
- ❌ Variable-length in OPTIONAL MATCH
- ❌ WITH clause composition
- ❌ UNION queries with variable-length
- ❌ ORDER BY on path results
- ❌ Aggregations over paths
- ❌ Performance with realistic data (1M+ nodes, 10M+ edges)

#### Edge Cases NOT Tested:
- ❌ Zero hops (`*0`)
- ❌ Inverted ranges (`*5..2`)
- ❌ Very deep paths (`*1..100`)
- ❌ Circular graphs
- ❌ Disconnected graphs
- ❌ Self-loops
- ❌ Bidirectional patterns
- ❌ Path length exactly at limit
- ❌ Empty result sets
- ❌ Timeout scenarios

**Test Coverage Estimate:** 40% of production scenarios

### 5. Error Handling (20% Complete) ⚠️

**Status:** Minimal error handling present

#### What Exists:
- ✅ Parser errors for invalid syntax
- ✅ Basic type checking in query planner

#### What's Missing:
- ❌ Validation of range values (min <= max)
- ❌ Meaningful error messages for invalid patterns
- ❌ Timeout detection and reporting
- ❌ Depth limit enforcement
- ❌ Cycle detection error handling
- ❌ Schema mismatch error messages
- ❌ Query complexity warnings

**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours

---

### 6. Performance Optimization (10% Complete) ⚠️

**Status:** Basic structure present, optimization missing

#### What Exists:
- ✅ Default max depth limit (10 for unbounded)
- ✅ Cycle detection prevents infinite loops
- ✅ Recursive CTE leverages ClickHouse native support

#### What's Missing:
- ❌ Configurable depth limits
- ❌ Query timeout handling
- ❌ Memory usage controls
- ❌ Index hints for ClickHouse
- ❌ SETTINGS for recursive_cte_evaluation_depth
- ❌ Monitoring and logging for slow queries
- ❌ Query plan analysis

- ❌ Optimization for specific graph patterns

**Estimated Effort:** 16-24 hours (including testing)

## Realistic Timeline

## Conclusion

Variable-length path traversal is **functionally implemented** for basic scenarios and represents solid foundational work. The core architecture (recursive CTE generation) is sound and the parser/planner integration is complete.

However, calling this "production-ready" would be **misleading and irresponsible**. Significant work remains:
- Critical bugs need fixing (column names, multi-hop base)
- Testing is inadequate (only happy path covered)
- Error handling is minimal
- Performance is unvalidated

**Honest Assessment:** This is **demo-ready** and **development-ready**, but **NOT production-ready**.

**Recommendation:** Fix critical issues, expand testing, then reassess production readiness.
