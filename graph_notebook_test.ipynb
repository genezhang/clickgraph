    "# Graph Visualization with graph-notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "For graph visualization in graph-notebook, you can use these magic commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Available Visualization Commands:\n",
    "- `%%opencypher bolt` - Execute Cypher queries and display results\n",
    "- `%%graph_notebook_vis` - Create network visualizations from query results\n",
    "- `%%neptune_ml` - Machine learning features (if available)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Network Graph Visualization:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%opencypher bolt\n",
    "MATCH (u1:User)-[r:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)\n",
    "WHERE u1.user_id < 10 AND u2.user_id < 10\n",
    "RETURN u1, r, u2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Force-directed Layout:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%graph_notebook_vis\n",
    "MATCH (u1:User)-[r:FOLLOWS]->(u2:User)\n",
    "WHERE u1.user_id < 5\n",
    "RETURN u1, r, u2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Path Visualization:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%opencypher bolt\n",
    "MATCH path = shortestPath((a:User)-[*]-(b:User))\n",
    "WHERE a.user_id = 1 AND b.user_id = 5\n",
    "RETURN path\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ClickGraph Features Tested:\n",
    "✅ **Basic Queries**: MATCH, RETURN, WHERE, LIMIT, ORDER BY\n",
    "✅ **Relationships**: Pattern matching with relationship types\n",
    "✅ **Aggregation**: COUNT, SUM, GROUP BY operations\n",
    "✅ **OPTIONAL MATCH**: LEFT JOIN semantics\n",
    "✅ **UNION/UNION ALL**: Combining multiple query results\n",
    "✅ **Variable-Length Paths**: [*n] patterns with optimizations\n",
    "✅ **Property Filtering**: Schema-based query optimization\n",
    "✅ **Graph Algorithms**: PageRank, shortestPath\n",
    "✅ **Performance**: Fast analytical queries on ClickHouse\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps:\n",
    "1. Try the visualization cells above\n",
    "2. Experiment with different query patterns\n",
    "3. Test with your own data schemas\n",
    "4. Compare performance with other graph databases"
