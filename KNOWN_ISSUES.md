## Recently Fixed

### Path Functions in WITH Clauses (CTEs)
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - December 26, 2025

**Problem**: VLP queries with `length(path)` in WITH clauses generated CTEs that used VLP internal aliases (`start_node`/`end_node`) instead of Cypher aliases (`u1`/`u2`) in SELECT items.

**Root Cause**: The `rewrite_vlp_union_branch_aliases` function was incorrectly rewriting WITH CTE bodies. When checking if endpoint aliases had JOINs, it checked the *outer* plan's JOINs, but when rewriting CTE bodies, those nested RenderPlans don't have JOINs yet (they're in the outer plan). This caused it to incorrectly rewrite `u1` → `start_node`.

**Fix**: Modified `rewrite_vlp_union_branch_aliases` to only apply `t` → `vlp_alias` mapping when rewriting CTE bodies, excluding endpoint alias rewrites entirely for CTEs. WITH CTEs have their own JOINs (`JOIN users AS u1`) so SELECT items should use those Cypher aliases.

**Verification**: All VLP + WITH clause tests pass:
- `test_vlp_with_filtering` ✅
- `test_vlp_with_and_aggregation` ✅

## Feature Limitations

The following Cypher features are **not implemented** (by design - read-only query engine):

### 1. Procedure Calls (APOC/GDS)
**Status**: ⚠️ NOT IMPLEMENTED (out of scope)  
**Example**: `CALL apoc.algo.pageRank(...)`  
**Reason**: ClickGraph is a SQL query translator, not a procedure runtime  
**Impact**: Blocks 4 LDBC BI queries (bi-10, bi-15, bi-19, bi-20)

### 2. Bidirectional Relationship Patterns  
**Status**: ⚠️ NOT IMPLEMENTED (non-standard syntax)  
**Example**: `(a)<-[:TYPE]->(b)` (both arrows on same relationship)  
**Workaround**: Use undirected pattern `(a)-[:TYPE]-(b)` or two MATCH clauses  
**Impact**: Blocks 1 LDBC BI query (bi-17)

### 3. Write Operations
**Status**: ❌ OUT OF SCOPE (read-only by design)  
**Not Supported**: `CREATE`, `SET`, `DELETE`, `MERGE`, `REMOVE`  
**Reason**: ClickGraph is a read-only analytical query engine for ClickHouse  
**Alternative**: Use native ClickHouse INSERT statements for data loading
