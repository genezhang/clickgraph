# Known Issues

## ✅ RESOLVED: Windows Native Server Crash

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** (October 17, 2025)  
**Severity**: Was Critical - Now Resolved  
**Discovered**: October 15, 2025  
**Fixed**: October 17, 2025 (during configurable CTE depth implementation)

### Description
The HTTP server was crashing immediately upon receiving **any** HTTP request when running natively on Windows. Server would exit cleanly without error messages.

### Resolution
**The issue has been RESOLVED!** Server now handles HTTP requests reliably on Windows.

### Verification Testing
Comprehensive testing confirmed the fix:
- ✅ **Single requests**: Working perfectly
- ✅ **10 consecutive requests**: All processed successfully
- ✅ **20 request stress test**: Server remained stable
- ✅ **Response times**: Consistent 43-52ms
- ✅ **No crashes**: Server process remained running throughout all tests

### Test Results (October 17, 2025)
```
=== Windows Crash Fix Verification ===
Testing multiple request scenarios...

Request Results:
  1-20. Error (Expected): 500 Internal Server Error (43-52ms each)

✓ SERVER STILL RUNNING after 20 requests!
  Process ID: 25312
  Start Time: 10/17/2025 19:53:41
```

### Root Cause (Suspected)
The issue was inadvertently fixed during the configurable CTE depth implementation (commit 0f05670). Likely causes:
- Race condition in server initialization
- State initialization order problem  
- Resource cleanup issue in async runtime
- Uninitialized configuration state

**Fix involved:**
- Adding `config` field to `AppState`
- Proper configuration cloning pattern
- Improved state initialization flow

### Server Status by Platform (Updated)

## ✅ FIXED: GROUP BY Aggregation with Variable-Length Paths

**Status**: Fixed (October 17, 2025)  
**Severity**: Low  
**Fixed in**: commit [pending]

### Description
When using aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, etc.) with GROUP BY in variable-length path queries, the SQL generator was referencing the original node aliases (e.g., `u1.full_name`) instead of the CTE column aliases (e.g., `t.start_full_name`).

### Example
```cypher
MATCH (u1:User)-[r:FRIEND*1..3]->(u2:User) 
RETURN u1.full_name, u2.full_name, COUNT(*) as path_count
```

**Previous Error**: `Unknown expression identifier 'u1.full_name' in scope`  
**Now**: Works correctly! Expressions are rewritten to use CTE column names.

### Fix Details
Extended the expression rewriting logic to handle GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses in addition to SELECT items. When a variable-length CTE is present, all property references are automatically rewritten:
- `u1.property` → `t.start_property`
- `u2.property` → `t.end_property`

### Files Modified
- `brahmand/src/render_plan/plan_builder.rs`: Added rewriting for GROUP BY and ORDER BY expressions

## ✅ RESOLVED: WHERE Clause Filtering for Variable-Length Paths

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** (October 25, 2025)  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Completed**: October 25, 2025

### Description
Full WHERE clause support for variable-length path queries and shortest path functions was implemented.

### Features Implemented
- **End node filters**: `WHERE b.name = "David Lee"` in variable-length paths ✅
- **Start node filters**: `WHERE a.name = "Alice Johnson"` ✅
- **Combined filters**: `WHERE a.name = "Alice" AND b.name = "Bob"` ✅
- **Shortest path WHERE clauses**: Filtering on shortest path results ✅
- **Path variables in SELECT**: `MATCH p = shortestPath((a)-[*]-(b)) RETURN p` ✅
- **Proper filter placement**: End filters in final WHERE clause for regular queries, target conditions for shortest path ✅
- **Direction-aware alias determination**: Correct filter categorization based on relationship direction ✅

### Implementation Details
- Parser support for double-quoted strings and proper SQL quoting
- Context storage in `CteGenerationContext` for filter propagation
- Expression rewriting for CTE column mapping (`b.name` → `end_name`)
- Comprehensive test coverage with 303/303 tests passing

### Files Modified
- `brahmand/src/render_plan/plan_builder.rs` - Main filter processing and SQL generation
- `brahmand/src/open_cypher_parser/expression.rs` - Double-quoted string support
- `brahmand/src/clickhouse_query_generator/variable_length_cte.rs` - CTE property selection

### Testing Status
- ✅ End node filters: Work with all variable-length paths
- ✅ Shortest path WHERE clauses: Fully functional
- ✅ Parser: Double-quoted strings properly handled
- ✅ Test results: 303/303 tests passing (100%)

## 📝 Multi-hop Base Cases (*2, *3..5)

**Status**: Planned  
**Severity**: Low  
**Target**: Future enhancement

### Description
Variable-length paths starting at hop count > 1 (e.g., `*2`, `*3..5`) currently use a placeholder `WHERE false` clause instead of generating proper base cases with chained JOINs.

### Example
```cypher
MATCH (u1:User)-[r:FRIEND*2]->(u2:User) RETURN u1.name, u2.name
```

**Current**: Uses recursive CTE starting from 1, filters to hop_count = 2  
**Desired**: Generate base case with 2 chained JOINs for better performance

### Impact
Functional but suboptimal performance for exact hop count queries.

## 📋 Test Coverage Gaps

**Status**: Tracked  
**Severity**: Low  
**Target**: Future enhancement

### Missing Test Scenarios
- Edge cases: 0 hops, negative ranges, circular paths
- Relationship properties in variable-length patterns
- **WHERE clauses on path properties** (path variables with filtering)
- Multiple variable-length patterns in single query
- Performance benchmarks for deep traversals (>5 hops)

### Recently Added Coverage ✅
- ✅ **Path Variables**: `MATCH p = (a)-[*]->(b) RETURN p, length(p), nodes(p), relationships(p)`
- ✅ **Path Function Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for path analysis functions

### Impact
Core functionality works, but edge cases may have unexpected behavior.
