    "## Variable-Length Path Test Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected SQL Generation Patterns:\n",
    "For variable-length path queries, the generated SQL should include:\n",
    "- **WITH RECURSIVE clause**: For iterative path traversal\n",
    "- **Base case**: Initial single-hop relationships\n",
    "- **Recursive case**: Extends paths by one hop in each iteration\n",
    "- **Hop counting**: `hop_count` field tracking path length\n",
    "- **Cycle detection**: Using `has()` function or path tracking to prevent infinite loops\n",
    "- **Hop limits**: WHERE clauses enforcing min/max hop constraints\n",
    "- **UNION ALL**: Combining results from different hop counts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Coverage:\n",
    "- ✅ Test 6: Variable-length range (1-3 hops)\n",
    "- ✅ Test 7: Fixed-length paths (*2)\n",
    "- ✅ Test 8: Upper-bounded paths (*..5)\n",
    "- ✅ Test 9: Unbounded paths (*)\n",
    "- ✅ Test 10: Typed variable-length paths\n",
    "- ✅ Test 11: Edge cases and error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "1. Fix compilation errors in Rust code\n",
    "2. Start the ClickGraph server\n",
    "3. Execute all test cells\n",
    "4. Validate SQL generation for each pattern\n",
    "5. Document any failures or unexpected behaviors"
