# File Cleanup Summary

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Purpose**: Clean up temporary files created during WHERE clause filter development

## Cleanup Strategy

### 🗑️ Files Deleted (No Historical Value)
- **Log files** (20+ files): `server_debug.log`, `baseline_err.log`, etc.
  - Temporary debug output from server runs
  - No unique information, can be regenerated
  
- **Temporary notes**: `new_chat_note.txt`
  - Scratch notes, information captured in proper docs

### 📦 Files Archived (Historical Value)
Moved to `archive/temp_files_YYYY-MM-DD/`

**Old Test Scripts** (30+ files):
- Superseded by comprehensive test suite
- Examples: `test_bolt.py`, `test_debug_sql.py`, `test_simple_query.py`
- Kept for reference but no longer actively used

**Old Session Summaries** (5 files):
- Previous session documentation
- Information consolidated in recent summaries
- Examples: `SESSION_RECAP.md`, `SESSION_SHORTEST_PATH.md`

**Debug Scripts** (8 files):
- One-off debugging scripts: `debug_sql.py`, `quick_test.py`
- Served their purpose, no longer needed

**Old Batch/PS1 Files** (6 files):
- Old server start scripts
- Configuration scripts that are no longer used

### ✅ Files Kept (Active Use)

**Current Test Files**:
- `test_where_comprehensive.py` - Variable-length path WHERE tests (4 tests)
- `test_shortest_path_with_filters.py` - shortestPath WHERE tests (4 tests)
- `test_optional_match.py` - OPTIONAL MATCH feature tests
- `test_viewscan.py` - ViewScan feature tests
- `test_runner.py` - Test framework

**Setup Scripts** (7 files):
- `setup_demo_data.sql`, `setup_social_test_memory.sql`, etc.
- Still used for creating test databases

**Configuration Files** (3 files):
- `social_network.yaml` - Main test schema
- `test_friendships.yaml` - Relationship test schema
- `ecommerce_graph_demo.yaml` - E-commerce demo schema

**Documentation** (8 files):
- Recent session summaries (last 3)
- `JOURNEY_RETROSPECTIVE.md` - Development narrative
- Cypher query examples (`.cypher` files)

**Other Essential Files**:
- Rust test files (`.rs`)
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)
- PowerShell utilities (`start_server_with_env.ps1`)

## File Count Summary

| Category | Count | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Deleted (logs, temp files) | ~25 | Removed permanently |
| Archived (old tests, debug scripts) | ~50 | Moved to archive/ |
| Kept (active use) | ~30 | Remain in root |

## Rationale

### Why Archive Instead of Delete?
Old test scripts and session summaries may contain useful patterns or debugging approaches. Archiving preserves them for reference while keeping the root directory clean.

### Why Keep Recent Tests?
- `test_where_comprehensive.py` and `test_shortest_path_with_filters.py` are the **current regression test suite** for the WHERE clause filter feature
- Other kept tests (`test_optional_match.py`, `test_viewscan.py`) cover other production features
- These are actively maintained and run regularly

### Why Keep Setup Scripts?
- SQL setup scripts create test databases for integration tests
- YAML config files define graph schemas for testing
- These are dependencies for running tests

## Running the Cleanup

```powershell
# Review what will be cleaned (dry run)
Get-Content cleanup_temp_files.ps1

# Execute cleanup
.\cleanup_temp_files.ps1

# Verify results
Get-ChildItem *.py, *.log, *.bat | Measure-Object
```

## Post-Cleanup Directory Structure

```
clickgraph/
├── test_where_comprehensive.py           ✓ Keep (recent tests)
├── test_shortest_path_with_filters.py    ✓ Keep (recent tests)
├── test_optional_match.py                ✓ Keep (feature test)
├── test_viewscan.py                      ✓ Keep (feature test)
├── setup_demo_data.sql                   ✓ Keep (setup script)

├── start_server_with_env.ps1             ✓ Keep (utility)
├── SESSION_WHERE_FILTERS_COMPLETE.md     ✓ Keep (recent summary)
├── archive/

│       ├── test_bolt.py                  📦 Archived
│       ├── test_debug_sql.py             📦 Archived
│       ├── SESSION_RECAP.md              📦 Archived
│       └── ... (50+ files)
└── (no log files)                        🗑️ Deleted
```

## Recovery

If any archived file is needed:
```powershell
# List archived files
Get-ChildItem archive/temp_files_2025-10-19/

# Restore a specific file
Copy-Item archive/temp_files_2025-10-19/test_bolt.py .
```

## Next Steps

After cleanup:
1. ✅ Root directory is clean and organized
2. ✅ Only active test files remain
3. ✅ Historical files preserved in archive/
4. ✅ Can focus on new feature development
