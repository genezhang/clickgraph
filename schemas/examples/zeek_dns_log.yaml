# Zeek DNS Log - Multi-Relationship Denormalized Edge Table Example
# 
# This schema demonstrates two relationship types from a single edge table,
# including a relationship that requires array flattening.
#
# Sample dns.log data:
# {
#   "ts": 1591367999.305988,
#   "uid": "CMdzit1AMNsmfAIiQc",
#   "id.orig_h": "192.168.4.76",      <- Source IP
#   "id.resp_h": "192.168.4.1",       <- DNS Server IP  
#   "query": "testmyids.com",         <- Domain queried
#   "qtype_name": "A",
#   "rcode_name": "NOERROR",
#   "answers": ["31.3.245.133"],      <- Resolved IPs (array!)
#   "TTLs": [3600]
# }
#
# Graph model:
#   Rule 1: (source_ip:IP)-[:REQUESTED]->(domain:Domain)
#           "192.168.4.76 requested testmyids.com"
#
#   Rule 2: (domain:Domain)-[:RESOLVED_TO]->(resolved_ip:IP)
#           "testmyids.com resolved_to 31.3.245.133"
#           NOTE: Requires ARRAY JOIN to flatten the answers array
