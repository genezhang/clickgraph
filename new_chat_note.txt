I'm continuing work on ClickGraph, a Rust-based graph analysis layer for ClickHouse that translates Cypher queries to SQL. Yesterday we completed major relationship traversal implementation.

Current Status:
- Basic relationship patterns working: MATCH (a)-[r:TYPE]->(b) 
- All 4 YAML relationship types functional (AUTHORED, FOLLOWS, LIKED, PURCHASED)
- Server runs in YAML-only mode: cargo run --bin brahmand -- --http-port 8081 --disable-bolt
- Key fix: brahmand/src/server/graph_catalog.rs line 417 - relationship schema loading
- Testing: test_relationships.ipynb notebook with 100% success rate
- Documentation: STATUS_REPORT.md with complete feature matrix

Latest commit: fa170d4 on graphview1 branch - "feat: implement relationship traversal support with YAML view integration"

Ready to work on: [mention what you want to focus on next - e.g., variable-length paths, performance optimization, additional Cypher features, etc.]

Key files to mention if you need specific help:

graph_catalog.rs - YAML schema loading
analyzer - Query planning logic
clickhouse_query_generator - SQL generation
social_network_view.yaml - Graph schema configuration
STATUS_REPORT.md - Complete feature documentation
- Next steps: variable-length paths, performance optimization, additional Cypher features
