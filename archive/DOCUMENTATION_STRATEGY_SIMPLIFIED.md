# Documentation Strategy - Simplified & Practical

**Created**: October 18, 2025  
**Goal**: Easy tracking of what's done, how we did it, and what's next - with minimal overhead

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Keep only 3 types of documents that matter:**

1. **CHANGELOG.md** - What we shipped (official releases)
2. **STATUS.md** - What works right now (living document)
3. **Session notes** - How we did it (one per feature)

Everything else is noise.

---

## 📁 The Three Documents

### 1. CHANGELOG.md (Release History)
**Update**: Only when merging to main/releasing  
**Purpose**: Official version history for users

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Feature X
- Feature Y

### Fixed
- Bug Z

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-18

### Added
- Initial release
```

**Keep it simple**: Just list what changed, when merging to main.

---

### 2. STATUS.md (Current State)
**Update**: After each significant feature  
**Purpose**: Single source of truth for "what works now"

**Structure**:
```markdown
# ClickGraph Status

*Updated: 2025-10-18*

## ✅ What Works

- **Simple Node Queries**: `MATCH (u:User) RETURN u.name` ✅
- **OPTIONAL MATCH**: `OPTIONAL MATCH (u)-[]->() RETURN u` ✅
- **ViewScan**: Labels → table names via YAML ✅

## 🚧 In Progress

- Relationship traversal with ViewScan

## ❌ Known Issues

- Variable-length paths max depth hardcoded

## 📊 Stats

- Tests: 261/262 passing (99.6%)
- Last updated: Oct 18, 2025

## 🎯 Next Priorities

1. ViewScan for relationships
2. Shortest path algorithms
3. Performance optimization
```

**Rule**: Always update this after finishing a feature. Delete old sections when no longer relevant.

---

### 3. Feature Notes (One Per Major Feature)
**Naming**: `notes/<feature-name>.md`  
**Purpose**: Remember how we built it and design decisions

**Structure**:
```markdown
# <Feature Name>

**Completed**: 2025-10-18  
**Tests**: X/Y passing

## What We Built

[2-3 sentence summary]

## How It Works

[Key architecture decisions]

```rust
// Key code snippet
```

## Gotchas & Learnings

- Thing that took 3 hours to debug
- Design decision that wasn't obvious

## What's NOT Done

- Known limitations
- Future enhancements
```

**Rule**: Create this when feature is complete. Keep it concise (1-2 pages max).

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

```
clickgraph/
├── README.md              # Project overview
├── CHANGELOG.md           # Release history
├── STATUS.md              # Current capabilities
├── notes/
│   ├── viewscan.md       # ViewScan feature notes
│   ├── optional-match.md # OPTIONAL MATCH notes
│   └── variable-paths.md # Variable-length paths notes
└── docs/
    └── (user-facing docs only)
```

**Everything else**: Delete or archive.

---

## 📝 Daily Workflow

### When You Finish a Feature

1. **Update STATUS.md** (2 minutes):
   ```
   - Move from "In Progress" to "What Works"
   - Update test count
   - Update "Next Priorities"
   ```

2. **Create feature note** (5 minutes):
   ```
   - Create notes/<feature>.md
   - Document key decisions and gotchas
   - Note what's NOT done
   ```

3. **Commit**:
   ```bash
   git add STATUS.md notes/<feature>.md
   git commit -m "docs: Update STATUS with <feature>"
   ```

**Total time**: ~7 minutes per feature

### When You Release

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md** (5 minutes):
   ```
   - Move [Unreleased] items to new version
   - Add release date
   ```

2. **Tag and push**:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push --tags
   ```

---

## 🧹 Cleanup Current Docs

### Keep These:
```
✅ README.md
✅ CHANGELOG.md (rename STATUS_REPORT.md content here)
✅ DEV_ENVIRONMENT_CHECKLIST.md (practical)
```

### Convert to Feature Notes:
```
VIEWSCAN_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md → notes/viewscan.md
OPTIONAL_MATCH_COMPLETE.md → notes/optional-match.md
VARIABLE_LENGTH_* (8 files!) → notes/variable-length-paths.md (merge all)
```

### Archive or Delete:
```
SESSION_COMPLETE.md → Archive (or delete if info in feature notes)
SESSION_SUMMARY_OCT17.md → Archive
*_DESIGN.md → Archive (unless actively referring to them)
*_INVESTIGATION.md → Archive (info captured in feature notes)
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Migration Script

```powershell
# 1. Create notes directory
mkdir notes

# 2. Create STATUS.md from STATUS_REPORT.md (keep the good parts)
# Edit manually - extract "What Works" section

# 3. Create feature notes (manual - consolidate key info)
# notes/viewscan.md - from VIEWSCAN_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
# notes/optional-match.md - from OPTIONAL_MATCH_COMPLETE.md
# notes/variable-length-paths.md - merge the 8 files

# 4. Archive old docs
mkdir archive
git mv SESSION_*.md archive/
git mv *_DESIGN.md archive/
git mv *_INVESTIGATION.md archive/
git mv VARIABLE_LENGTH_*.md archive/

# 5. Commit
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: Simplify documentation structure

- Created STATUS.md as single source of truth
- Moved feature docs to notes/ directory
- Archived historical session summaries
- Reduced from 30+ docs to 3 core docs + feature notes"
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

After cleanup, you should have:
- [ ] **3 core docs**: README, CHANGELOG, STATUS
- [ ] **~5 feature notes**: One per major feature in `notes/`
- [ ] **1 checklist**: DEV_ENVIRONMENT_CHECKLIST (practical)
- [ ] Everything else archived or deleted

**Total docs in root**: ~5 files  
**Current docs in root**: ~30 files

---

## 💡 Why This Works

**Problems with current approach**:
- ❌ 30+ markdown files in root directory
- ❌ Multiple docs for same feature (8 for variable-length!)
- ❌ Hard to find current status
- ❌ Overlapping information
- ❌ "Should I update X or Y or both?"

**This simplified approach**:
- ✅ Single source of truth (STATUS.md)
- ✅ One note per feature (easy to find)
- ✅ Clear update triggers (finish feature → update STATUS + create note)
- ✅ No duplicate information
- ✅ Low maintenance overhead

---

## 📋 Template: STATUS.md

```markdown
# ClickGraph Status

*Updated: 2025-10-18*

## ✅ What Works

**Query Features**:
- Simple node queries: `MATCH (n:User) RETURN n` ✅
- Property filtering: `WHERE n.age > 25` ✅
- OPTIONAL MATCH: `OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[]->(m)` ✅
- Variable-length paths: `(n)-[*1..3]->()` ✅
- ViewScan: Label → table translation ✅

**Infrastructure**:
- HTTP API (Axum)
- Bolt protocol v4.4
- YAML schema configuration
- Docker deployment

## 🚧 In Progress

- ViewScan for relationship traversal

## 🎯 Next Up

1. ViewScan relationships (high priority)
2. Shortest path algorithms
3. Performance benchmarking

## 📊 Current Stats

- **Tests**: 261/262 passing (99.6%)
- **Last feature**: ViewScan (Oct 18)
- **Branch**: graphview1

## ❌ Known Issues

- Bolt version string formatting test fails (cosmetic)
- ViewScan only works for nodes, not relationships yet

## 📖 Feature Notes

See `notes/` directory for implementation details:
- [viewscan.md](notes/viewscan.md)
- [optional-match.md](notes/optional-match.md)
- [variable-length-paths.md](notes/variable-length-paths.md)
```

## 📋 Template: Feature Note

```markdown
# <Feature Name>

**Completed**: 2025-MM-DD  
**Tests**: X/Y passing  
**Commits**: `abc123f`, `def456g`

## Summary

[1-2 sentences: what we built]

## How It Works

[Architecture overview with key code locations]

**Key Files**:
- `path/to/file.rs` - Does X
- `path/to/other.rs` - Does Y

**Data Flow**:
```
Input → Parser → Planner → SQL Generator → ClickHouse → Response
         ^^^^     ^^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^^^^^
       We added   We added   We added this part
       this       this
```

## Design Decisions

**Why we did X instead of Y**:
- Reason 1
- Reason 2

## Gotchas & Debugging Stories

**The 3-hour Docker Mystery** (if relevant):
[Brief story of major debugging session - helps future you]

## Code Examples

```rust
// Key implementation snippet
fn example() {
    // ...
}
```

```cypher
-- Example query
MATCH (n:User) RETURN n.name
```

## Limitations

- Doesn't support X yet
- Edge case Y needs handling

## Future Work

- [ ] Add support for Z
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] More tests for edge cases
```

---

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Do this now** (30 minutes):

1. Create `STATUS.md` from best parts of `STATUS_REPORT.md`
2. Create `notes/` directory
3. Create one example note: `notes/viewscan.md`
4. Archive everything else to `archive/` directory

**Result**: Clear structure, easy to maintain, all info preserved.

**Then**: Use this pattern going forward. Update STATUS after each feature. Create one note per feature. That's it.

**Thoughts?** This reduces complexity while keeping all the essential tracking you need.
